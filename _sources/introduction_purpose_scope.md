# Introduction, purpose and scope
{term}`SST` is an essential climate variable {cite:p}`Bojinski2014` that is crucial for a wide range of applications, such as e.g. input to {term}`NWP` models {cite:p}`Brasnett2016,Chelton2005` and ocean models {cite:p}`LeTraon2015,Liang2017`, for understanding air-sea interactions {cite:p}`Monzikova2017,Ning2018` and monitoring the climate {cite:p}`Merchant2019`. Observations of {term}`SST` from {term}`IR` satellites have been available since the early 1980's, however these observations are affected by atmospheric aerosols and limited to clear-sky conditions {cite:p}`Reynolds2002,Vasquez2004,Merchant2019`. {term}`PMW` observations of {term}`SST` are an important and complementary alternative as they are not affected by non-precipitating clouds and the effect from aerosols is negligible {cite:p}`Ulaby1981,Wentz2000a,Donlon2007`.

The first {term}`PMW` {term}`SST` observations were retrieved in 1978 from measurements by {term}`SMMR`, which was carried on Seasat 1 and Nimbus 7 {cite:p}`Lipes1982,Milman1985`. However, the retrieved {term}`SST`s contained large errors {cite:p}`Milman1985` and were of a very coarse spatial resolution, which limited their usefulness. In 1997, the {term}`TMI` was launched, providing {term}`SST` observations between 40$^{\circ}$N/S in the period 1998 to 2014 {cite:p}`Kummerow1998,Wentz2015`. Global and accurate {term}`PMW` {term}`SST`s were first measured in 2002 by {term}`AMSR-E`, from {term}`NASA`'s Aqua platform {cite:p}`Kawanishi2003`. In October 2011, {term}`AMSR-E` ceased normal operations and in 2012 the follow-on mission, {term}`AMSR2`, was launched onboard {term}`GCOM-W1` {cite:p}`Imaoka2010`

The resolution of the current microwave imagers are not enough to capture subscale to mesoscale variability. Furthermore, they suffer from coastal and sea ice contamination at the 6.9 GHz channels due to the large field of view (e.g. {term}`AMSR2` has a 64 $\times$ 32 km field of view at 6.9 GHz). As the spatial resolution of {term}`SST` observations are limited by e.g. the ratio of the wavelength of the measurement to the antenna diameter {cite:p}`Wentz2000b`, a larger antenna is necessary to obtain a high spatial resolution. Therefore, an improvement of the spatial resolution of measurements from the 6.9 and 10.7 GHz channels could result in a significant improvement of {term}`PMW` {term}`SST` observations and their information content in global products and regional analysis systems.

{term}`CIMR` is currently being prepared by {term}`ESA` as a part of the Copernicus Expansion program of the European Union (http://www.cimr.eu/). {term}`CIMR` is designed to observe high-resolution and high-accuracy global {term}`PMW` measurements of {term}`SST`, {term}`WS`, {term}`SSS` and {term}`SIC` as primary variables from radiometer channels at 1.4, 6.9, 10.7, 18.7 and 36.5 GHz from a Sun-synchronous polar orbit {cite:p}`Donlon2020`.

This {term}`ATBD` describes the algorithm for the retrieval of {term}`SST` from {term}`CIMR`. The algorithm consists of a statistically-based regression retrieval for {term}`SST` and an optional regression-based retrieval for {term}`WS`.
