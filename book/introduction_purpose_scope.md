# Introduction, purpose and scope
Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential climate variable {cite:p}`Bojinski2014` that is crucial for a wide range of applications, such as e.g. input to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models {cite:p}`Brasnett2016,Chelton2005` and ocean models {cite:p}`LeTraon2015,Liang2017`, for understanding air-sea interactions {cite:p}`Monzikova2017,Ning2018` and monitoring the climate {cite:p}`Merchant2019`. Observations of SST from infrared (IR) satellites have been available since the early 1980's, however these observations are affected by atmospheric aerosols and limited to clear-sky conditions {cite:p}`Reynolds2002,Vasquez2004,Merchant2019`. Passive microwave (PMW) observations of SST are important and complementary alternatives as they are not affected by non-precipitating clouds and the effect from aerosols is negligible {cite:p}`Ulaby1981,Wentz2000a,Donlon2007`.

The first PMW SST observations were retrieved in 1978 from measurements by the Scaning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), which was carried on Seasat 1 and Nimbus 7 {cite:p}`Lipes1982,Milman1985`. However, the retrieved SSTs contained large errors {cite:p}`Milman1985` and were of a very coarse spatial resolution, which limited their usefulness. In 1997, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) was launched, providing SST observations between 40$^{\circ}$N/S in the period 1998 to 2014 {cite:p}`Kummerow1998,Wentz2015`. Global and accurate PMW SSTs were first measured in 2002 by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), from the National Aeronautics Space Administration's (NASA's) Aqua platform {cite:p}`Kawanishi2003`. In October 2011, AMSR-E ceased normal operations and in 2012 the follow-on mission, the Advanced Microwave Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), was launched onboard the Global Change Observing Mission 1st - Water (GCOM-W1) {cite:p}`Imaoka2010`

The resolution of the current microwave imagers are not enough to capture subscale to mesoscale variability. Furthermore, they suffer from coastal and sea ice contamination at the 6.9 GHz channels due to the large field of view (e.g. AMSR2 has a 64 $\times$ 32 km field of view at 6.9 GHz). As the spatial resolution of SST observations are limited by e.g. the ratio of the wavelength of the measurement to the antenna diameter {cite:p}`Wentz2000b`, a larger antenna is necessary to obtain a high spatial resolution. Therefore, an improvement of the spatial resolution of measurements from the 6.9 and 10.7 GHz channels could result in a significant improvement of PMW SST observations and their information content in global products and regional analysis systems.

The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) is currently being prepared by the European Space Agency (ESA) as a part of the Copernicus Expansion program of the European Uniion (http://www.cimr.eu/). CIMR is designed to observe high-resolution and high-accuracy global PWM measurements of SST, ocean wind speed (WS), sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea ice concentration (SIC) as primary variables from radiometer channels at 1.4, 6.9, 10.7, 18.7 and 36.5 GHz from a Sun-synchronous polar orbit {cite:p}`Donlon2019`.

This algorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) describes the algorithm for the retrieval of SST from CIMR. The algorithm consists of a statistically-based regression retrieval for SST and an optionoal regression-based retrieval for WS.
