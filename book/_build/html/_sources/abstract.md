# Abstract
Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential climate variable {cite:p}`Bojinski2014` that is crucial for a wide range of applications, such as e.g. input to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models {cite:p}`Brasnett2016,Chelton2005` and ocean models {cite:p}`LeTraon2015,Liang2017`, for understanding air-sea interactions {cite:p}`Monzikova2017,Ning2018` and monitoring the climate {cite:p}`Merchant2019`. Observations of SST from infrared (IR) satellites have been available since the early 1980's, however these observations are affected by atmospheric aerosols and limited to clear-sky conditions {cite:p}`Reynolds2002,Vasquez2004,Merchant2019`. Passive microwave (PMW) observations of SST are important and complementary alternatives as they are not affected by non-precipitating clouds and the effect from aerosols is negligible {cite:p}`Ulaby1981,Wentz2000a,Donlon2007`.

This algorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) describes the algorithm for the retrieval of SST from the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR). The algorithm consists of a statistically-based regression retrieval for SST and an optionoal regression-based retrieval for wind speed (WS).
