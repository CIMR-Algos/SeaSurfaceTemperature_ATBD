# Background and justification of selected algorithm
There exists a wide range of retrieval algorithms for {term}`PMW` {term}`SST` using different approaches and channel combinations. Among these, two main approaches can be identified; statistical algorithms and physically-based algorithms. Statistically-based retrieval algorithms relate the information from satellite measured brightness temperatures and additional data, such as e.g. atmospheric and oceanic reanalysis data, to in situ observations {cite:p}`Shibata2006,Wentz2007,Gentemann2009,Chang2015,Alerskans2020`. The physically-based retrieval algorithms, on the other hand, use an {term}`RTM` to simulate the top of the atmosphere brightness temperatures given instrument information, such as e.g. azimuth and earth incidence angles, frequency and polarization, and atmospheric and oceanic information, such as e.g. {term}`SST`, {term}`SSS`, {term}`WS`, water vapor density, liquid water density and atmospheric profiles of temperature. Among these, one frequently used approach is optimal estimation (OE), in which the {term}`RTM` is inverted given apriori atmospheric and oceanic information (and associated uncertainties) and satellite measured brightness temperatures to retrieve {term}`SST` {cite:p}`Nielsen2018`.

The advantage of the OE approach is that it allows for indication of measurement errors, such as e.g. imperfect calibration and channel contamination {cite:p}`Minnett2019`. However, this also means that the performance of OE algorithms depends on the accuracy of the {term}`RTM` and the representativeness of the observations and prior error covariances {cite:p}`Merchant2020`. Furthermore, ad-hoc corrections to the retrievals are necessary to deal with measurement errors {cite:p}`Meissner2012,Nielsen2018`. Statistically-based retrieval algorithms, on the other hand, partly includes the effect of measurement errors during the coefficient derivation process. However, a drawback of this type of methods is that they are constrained by established statistical relationship between the geophysical variables considered in order to simulate the processes that influence the surface emissivity and radiative transfer through the atmosphere. Therefore, both the physical and statistical retrieval algorithms make assumptions about the nature of the radiative transfer process.

The performance of these types of retrieval algorithms is well-documented for retrieval of {term}`PMW` {term}`SST` from {term}`AMSR-E` and {term}`AMSR2`. For statistically-based algorithms, independent validation using in situ observations have reported biases around $\pm$0.05 K and standard deviations in the range 0.45-0.55 K {cite:p}`Ocarroll2008,Gentemann2014,Gentemann2015,Alerskans2020` for {term}`AMSR-E` and {term}`AMSR2` retrieved {term}`PMW` {term}`SST`s. {cite:t}`Nielsen2018` reported a bias and standard deviation of 0.02 $\pm$ 0.47 K for {term}`AMSR-E` {term}`PMW` {term}`SST`s using a physically-based retrieval algorithm.

The algorithm approach chosen for retrieval of {term}`PMW` {term}`SST`s for the {term}`CIMR` Level 2 product is a statistically-based model based on the work done by {cite:t}`Alerskans2020`.
