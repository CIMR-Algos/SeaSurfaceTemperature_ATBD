Example figure. Figure numbering should be chronological, following the numbering of the figures in previous chapters.

Here is a math block
$
  \int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15}
$

Here are labeled and numbered equations

```{math}
:label: my_label
w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1}
```

```{math}
:label: my_other_label
w_{t+2} = (1 + r_{t+2}) s(w_t) + y_{t+2}
```
